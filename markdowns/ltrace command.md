## üß† **What is `ltrace`?**

`ltrace` is a Linux command-line tool that **traces calls to dynamic library functions** made by a program during execution ‚Äî mostly functions from the **C standard library (glibc)**.

---

### ‚úÖ `ltrace` is useful when:

- The program is written in **C or C++**
    
- The program uses dynamically linked **standard C library functions**, such as:
    
    - `strcmp`, `fgets`, `malloc`, `printf`, `puts`, `exit`, etc.
        
- You want to **reverse engineer simple C binaries** (e.g., in CTFs or OverTheWire wargames)
    

---

### ‚öôÔ∏è How `ltrace` works

- When you run a dynamically linked binary, it uses **shared libraries** like `libc.so`.
    
- `ltrace` intercepts calls to these shared libraries and logs:
    
    - the **function name**
        
    - its **arguments**
        
    - and the **return value**
        

---

### üìå Common usage

```bash
ltrace ./program
```

Useful flags:

|Flag|Meaning|
|---|---|
|`-s <num>`|Print up to `<num>` characters of strings (default is 32)|
|`-e <func>`|Trace only specific function(s), e.g. `-e strcmp`|
|`-o <file>`|Write output to a file|
|`-f`|Trace child processes (like `fork`)|

Example:

```bash
ltrace -s 128 -e strcmp ./check
```

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations

- Doesn‚Äôt work on **statically compiled** binaries.
    
- Can‚Äôt trace **custom functions** implemented inside the binary.
    
- Doesn‚Äôt work well with **languages that don‚Äôt rely on libc**, such as:
    
    - Go (statically compiled)
        
    - Rust (often statically linked)
        
    - Python (runs bytecode inside its own VM)

## üîÑ **Similar Tools for Other Languages / Scenarios**

|Language / Runtime|Tool|Description|
|---|---|---|
|**C (syscalls)**|`strace`|Traces **system calls** (e.g. `open`, `read`, `write`)|
|**Python (CPython)**|`sys.settrace()` / `pdb`|For tracing Python code internally (not libc calls)|
|**Java**|`jstack`, `jmap`, `jtrace`|For monitoring JVM stack traces and memory|
|**Go**|`delve` (debugger)|For stepping through Go code, since Go binaries are often statically compiled|
|**Rust**|`gdb`, `rr`, `perf`|Use native debuggers like `gdb`, or record/replay tools|
|**Node.js**|`--inspect`, `chrome://inspect`|Debugging JavaScript and async behavior|
|**Any ELF binary**|`gdb`, `radare2`, `ghidra`|Full low-level debugging and disassembly|

## üìò Summary

- **`ltrace` = trace calls to dynamic library functions (mostly C).**
    
- Best used for **simple C/C++ binaries**.
    
- **Not effective** on statically linked binaries or interpreted languages.
    
- For other runtimes, use tools that **trace the language‚Äôs own virtual machine or runtime**.
