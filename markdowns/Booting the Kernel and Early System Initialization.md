## ✅ **Chapter 5 Summary: Booting the Kernel and Early System Initialization**

---

### **➡️ BIOS, UEFI, MBR, and GPT:**

- **Author's point:**
    
    - BIOS and UEFI are the two main firmware types that boot your system.
        
    - BIOS traditionally uses **MBR (Master Boot Record)** partitioning.
        
    - UEFI uses **GPT (GUID Partition Table)** and reads bootloaders as regular files from the **EFI System Partition (ESP)**.
        
    - MBR has a **2 TB disk size limit**, supports up to 4 primary partitions (or logical partitions inside an extended one).
        
    - GPT removes these limits and supports redundancy and larger disks.
        
- **Your takeaway:** BIOS and UEFI are not the same as MBR/GPT; BIOS/UEFI are firmware, MBR/GPT are disk partitioning schemes.
    
- **Clarification:** UEFI can emulate BIOS via **CSM (Compatibility Support Module)**, but normally works with GPT and `.efi` files.

### **➡️ Secure Boot:**

- **Author's point:**
    
    - Secure Boot (a feature of UEFI) blocks unsigned bootloaders from running.
        
    - Windows and most major Linux distros (Ubuntu, Fedora, etc.) ship signed bootloaders, so they work without problems.
        
    - If you write your own bootloader, it won’t run unless signed and approved by the firmware or Secure Boot is disabled.
        
- **Your takeaway:** Windows bootloaders (even pirated copies) work because they still use Microsoft’s signed bootloader. Secure Boot checks the bootloader’s signature, not the OS license.

### **➡️ Boot Process Basics (BIOS + MBR vs UEFI + GPT):**

- **Author's point:**
    
    - BIOS reads the MBR and loads raw code (no filesystem awareness).
        
    - UEFI reads the ESP (FAT32 filesystem), locates `.efi` files, and runs them like regular programs.
        
    - ESP is mounted at `/boot/efi` in Linux.
        
    - Each OS or bootloader has its own directory on ESP: e.g., `/boot/efi/EFI/ubuntu/`, `/boot/efi/EFI/microsoft/`.
        
- **Your takeaway:** In UEFI, bootloaders are just normal files in ESP, easy to manage, replace, or add.

### **➡️ GRUB and Its Configuration:**

- **Author's point:**
    
    - GRUB reads its config from `/boot/grub/grub.cfg`.
        
    - This config is **generated automatically** using scripts in `/etc/grub.d/` and the tool `grub-mkconfig`.
        
    - GRUB itself doesn’t run these scripts at boot — the scripts run earlier in user space to build `grub.cfg`.
        
    - The `40_custom` script lets you add manual entries but can be overwritten during upgrades.
        
    - The `41_custom` script loads an external `custom.cfg` file at boot (safer, because upgrades don’t overwrite it).
        
    - GRUB's modularity and config generation process make it easy to support multiple OSes.
        
- **Your takeaway:**
    
    - You now understand the difference between config **generation time** (with shell scripts) and **execution time** (GRUB commands only).
        
    - GRUB shows the boot menu on your Mint system, offering both Mint and Windows because it scans for all available OS bootloaders.

### **➡️ Chainloading:**

- **Author's point:**
    
    - Chainloading is the process where GRUB loads another bootloader instead of the kernel directly.
        
    - This is useful in mixed environments (e.g., GRUB loads Windows Boot Manager).
        
    - More common with BIOS+MBR setups, but still relevant in UEFI sometimes.
        
- **Your takeaway:** Chainloading is less common on UEFI, where each bootloader can live independently in ESP, but it’s still used when needed.

### **➡️ GRUB Device Naming and UUIDs:**

- **Author's point:**
    
    - GRUB uses its own device naming (`hd0,msdos1`, `hd0,gpt2`).
        
    - To avoid problems when device order changes, GRUB finds partitions by **UUID**.
        
    - Example search command: `search --fs-uuid --set=root <uuid>`
        
- **Your takeaway:** UUIDs ensure GRUB finds the correct partition regardless of the physical disk order.

### **➡️ Your Overall Realizations:**

- UEFI booting is **cleaner and more understandable** than BIOS+MBR booting.
    
- In your Mint + Windows setup:
    
    - GRUB is your primary bootloader, showing the menu with both OS options.
        
    - Each OS has its own `.efi` file in the ESP.
        
    - Bootloaders are modular and interchangeable in UEFI.
        
- You realized that partitioning in Linux (`/home`, `/var`, `/boot`, etc.) is like having multiple disks in Windows (`C:`, `D:`), but with more logical structure and flexibility.
    
- You clarified that LVM works on top of partitions or disks, regardless of MBR or GPT, and lets you combine multiple physical storage devices.
