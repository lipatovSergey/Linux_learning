## 🧠 What does `strings` do?

The `strings` command:

```bash
strings ./file
```

👉 **Extracts and prints all readable (printable) character sequences** from a binary file — typically ASCII or UTF-8 strings.

---

### 📌 Details:

- It scans the file for **sequences of printable characters** (letters, numbers, symbols).
    
- By default, it only shows **strings 4 characters or longer**.
    
- Commonly reveals:
    
    - Error messages: `Access denied`, `Try again`
        
    - Hardcoded values: `secret123`, file paths like `/etc/passwd`
        
    - Any readable string compiled into the binary
        

---

## 🛠 Example usage

```bash
strings ./check
```

Might output:

```
Enter password:
Wrong password.
secret123
```

➡️ This may hint that `"secret123"` is the correct input — useful in CTFs and reverse engineering.

## 🔧 Useful options

| Flag             | Description                                    |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `-n N` or `-<N>` | Minimum string length (default is 4)           |
| `-t x`           | Show string offsets (e.g., `x` = hexadecimal)  |
| `-e s`           | Specify character encoding (e.g., `s` = ASCII) |

Example:

```bash
strings -n 6 -t x ./check
```

---

## ⚠️ Limitations

- Only shows **literal, hardcoded strings**.
    
- It **does not** show:
    
    - Dynamically generated strings
        
    - Encrypted or obfuscated text
        
    - Context (how/where the string is used in code)
        

---

## 🧠 Key takeaway

> `strings` is a **quick and simple tool** to find readable data inside binaries — but it doesn’t show how those strings are used.

To dig deeper into logic and behavior, combine it with tools like:

- `ltrace` (for library calls)
    
- `strace` (for system calls)
    
- `gdb`, `radare2`, or `ghidra` (for full reverse engineering)
