#Linux 
**A file system** is a way for the operating system to organize and manage files within a disk _partition or volume_.  
It determines how data is stored, named, and retrieved.
### 📘 Extended Table: File Systems in Linux

| **File System** | **Use Case**                                 | **Features and Notes**                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------- | -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ext2**        | Legacy systems, Live USBs, disk images       | ❌ No journaling (slow recovery),✅ Simple and stable, widely supported,🪶 Lightweight — good for flash drives                                                  |
| **ext3**        | Older servers, ext2 compatibility            | ✅ Journaling (metadata only),↩️ Backward-compatible with ext2 (can be mounted as ext2),🐢 Slower than ext4                                                    |
| **ext4**        | 📌 Default on most Linux distros             | ✅ Journaling (metadata and/or data),📁 Supports files >16 TB, volumes up to 1 EB,↩️ Backward-compatible with ext2/ext3,⚙️ Delayed allocation, extents, faster |
| **XFS**         | Servers, large files, databases              | 🚀 Excellent performance with large files,📅 Full journaling, highly parallel,⛔ Cannot shrink volumes                                                         |
| **Btrfs**       | Modern systems, testing, NAS                 | 🧷 Snapshots, checksums, built-in RAID,📦 Compression, deduplication, subvolumes,⚠️ Still less mature than ext4 in some kernels                               |
| **FAT32**       | USB drives, cameras, universal compatibility | 📺 Recognized by all OSes and devices,⛔ Max file size 4 GB,❌ No journaling or permissions                                                                     |
| **exFAT**       | Large USB/SD cards (>32 GB)                  | 📦 Supports large files (>4 GB),🔄 Cross-platform, FAT32 successor,❌ No journaling, needs `exfat-utils` in Linux                                              |
| **NTFS**        | Accessing Windows drives                     | 📂 Journaling, access control, ACL support,🔧 In Linux used via `ntfs-3g` (slower),⚠️ Best used for data exchange with Windows                                |
| **ISO9660**     | CD/DVD, ISO images                           | 📀 Read-only,📂 Supports Joliet, Rock Ridge extensions,📦 Used with `mkisofs`, `genisoimage`                                                                  |
| **tmpfs**       | Temporary runtime files (`/tmp`, `/run`)     | 🧠 Stored in RAM,🧹 Cleared on reboot,🚀 Extremely fast access                                                                                                |
| **proc**        | Virtual FS for kernel info (`/proc`)         | 🔍 Shows running processes and kernel parameters,📄 Files are dynamic, not stored on disk                                                                     |
| **sysfs**       | Devices and drivers (`/sys`)                 | 🔌 Interface to kernel device tree,🧩 Supports hotplug and hardware control                                                                                   |
| **overlayfs**   | Containers (Docker/Podman), live systems     | 🧱 Combines read-only and writable layers,📦 Used in Docker image layering and live CDs                                                                       |
